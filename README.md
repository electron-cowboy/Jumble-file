# Jumble-file
A small python scriptlet to jumble the lines of a small file

Great for taking lists of something and creating a random list 

Use cases: 
  You have a large list , and want to take a small random sample of that list - take the first 150 lines after jumbling.
  You have a list of servers, and don't want to hit them in the same order each time.
  You have a list of names, and want to group them in random order for batches of email.
